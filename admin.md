# Admin

* One idea in terms of admin would be for the leadership of the club to be directly able to edit the page without changing the actual code for it

* For example, they could update meeting times, insert forms, or post new Youtube Videos on the website directly from the front end, rather than having us, or anyone else, hard-code it on the backend 

* This would be the use of a database than save the admin inputted data 

* Users then can easily access everything; they would not have a log in
