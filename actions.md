# Actions Within Site

* This website will contain a calendar with dates for teaching sessions so people can easily schedule their students and see if they are available

* There will also be small coding tutorials/youtube videos to clarify content in class and serve as a way for absent students to catch up on any material they missed 

* Lastly, we plan to institute contact and sign-up forms that allow parents to easily register for classes

* Databases will allow for us to keep track of everyone who has signed up for the class and make it easy to use and understand for everyone
