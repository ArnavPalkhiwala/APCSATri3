# Technical Plan

Here is a UML diagram outlining our plan for the website:
[![Blank-diagram-1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/9FJVZs7W/Blank-diagram-1.png)](https://postimg.cc/QH9Rr4mP)


One of our main MVC ideas is to create a calendar on which website users can see the Coding4Kidz class schedule, as well as sign up for classes. For this feature, we will need a database to store signups and lesson dates/times.
We would also like to have a page/pages where students can view lessons on the Coding4Kidz curriculum, and this can also take them to a place where they can submit a feedback form.

* We are still deciding if we will have/need a login page

* If implemented, this could have user and admin features (info on a later slide)

* The main pages beyond the home page will be a calendar, an about page, and a place to access online learning materials

* Every page will also have a navbar for easy navigation to these pages, as well as a footer with contact information and the Coding4Kidz YouTube channel
