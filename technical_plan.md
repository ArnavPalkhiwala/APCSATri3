# Technical Plan

Here is a UML diagram outlining our plan for the website:

One of our main MVC ideas is to create a calendar on which website users can see the Coding4Kidz class schedule, as well as sign up for classes. For this feature, we will need a database to store signups and lesson dates/times.
We would also like to have a page/pages where students can view lessons on the Coding4Kidz curriculum, and this can also take them to a place where they can submit a feedback form.
