        <h1><strong>Welcome To Coding4Kidz!</strong></h1>
        <h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>We are students at Del Norte High School with a passion for computer science and helping others. </li>
            <li>When we were in elementary/middle school, we experienced programming classes for the first time and enjoyed it thoroughly</li>
            <li>As we got into high school, this motivated us to create a free resource that all children in our community can access.</li>
            <li>That is how Coding4Kidz was born.</li>
        </ol>
        <h6>This website was created by AP Computer Science A students -- Arnav Palkhiwala, Aman Jain, Christopher Duroiu, and Raquib Alam -- in Spring of 2022.</h6>
