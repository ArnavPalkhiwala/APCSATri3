- Project Owner Described: Our work is sponsored by Coding4Kidz (a DNHS club that teaches local elementary school students how to code)
- This website will contain a calendar with dates for teaching sessions, small coding tutorials/youtube videos to clarify content in class, as well as contact and sign-up forms that allow parents to easily register for classes.
- We plan to use Databases to keep track of the students registered and sign-ups and a sleek front end design will be made with bootstrap
- Figma will be used as a wireframe and is [linked here](https://www.figma.com/file/ZlMdwXET7GXIKG1iqHcoZN/AP-CSA-Tri-3-Coding4Kidz?node-id=0%3A1)

# Objectives for final 13 school days 'till N@tM
- Our key object here is to have an easy to use website that is functioning because the more friction there is in the process, the more difficult it will be for Coding4Kidz users to use it; eventually they may stop using it also whihch is opposite of what we want
- We want to have an implemented calendar done where we can easily add and display events that C4K will have such as webinars and lives classes
- Add a nice embedding of Youtube videos on a specific page where users do not need to leave the page 
- Embedded sign up or contact form on its own page
- At this point, it seems like having a login will not make sense in terms of time and it will not be a priority; however if there is time at the end, we do plan to have some implentation for this

# How these objectives are meeting needs of Teacher or Sponsor
- The implentation of calendar will be extremely helpful for the club because it will give parents ands students a clear view of when classes are scheduled for 
- This would be better because currently, parents have to email the club for questions, so this will save everyone time overall
- Embedding of Youtube video is something that club leadership really wants because their Youtube channel currently has limited views and exposure, but putting it ont he website directly would change that 
- Lastly, for sign up forms and contact forms, users of the website currently have to leave the page to a linked Google Form; this is why the club wants them directly on the website to eliminate friction and that is exactly what we are working on
